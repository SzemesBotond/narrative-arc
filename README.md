# Narrative Arc
Measure and plot the narrative arc of literary fiction

Find codes in the subfolder to three different methods based on the changes of 1) frequency of verbs; 2) average sentence lenght; 3) frequency of sentiment words in a text.

As an example see "text" folder of short stories by Gyula Krúdy and Dezső Kosztolányi (plain text as well as the results of the e-magyar NLP software with lemmatization, POS-tagging and morphological analysis). Use plain text to measure sentence length and NLP annotation to measure the frequancy of verbs and sentiment words.
